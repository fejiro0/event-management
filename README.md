# Campus Event Management Hub

## Project Overview

The **Campus Event Management Hub** is a web application where students and staff can view, register, and manage campus events such as workshops, seminars, and club activities. The system allows users to:

- Register and log in to create personal event preferences.
- View upcoming events, including their details like name, date, time, location, and available seats.
- RSVP for events, which updates the number of available seats and saves the events to their profile.
- Admin users can create events, specifying event details, capacity, and more.
- A calendar view that displays events based on the selected date, with filters based on event preferences.

## Features

- **User Registration & Event Preferences**: Students and staff can register and set preferences for types of events.
- **Event Listings & RSVP**: Users can browse events, check available seats, and RSVP to participate.
- **Event Creation (Admin Only)**: Only admins can create events, specifying the event name, description, location, and capacity.
- **Event Calendar View**: A calendar view allows users to see events by date, and filter events based on preferences.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed on your machine.
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas) for storing user data and events.
- **Git** for version control.

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an `.env` file in the root directory** to configure environment variables. Here's an example of the required `.env` file:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend and Backend Integration

- Ensure the **API endpoints** on the backend are being correctly consumed by the frontend application.
- The frontend makes **HTTP requests** to the backend API for user registration, event listing, RSVP, and event creation.
- The frontend can be configured to use **Axios** or **Fetch API** to make requests to the backend endpoints.

## Features

### 1. **User Registration & Event Preferences**

- **Registration**: Users can sign up by providing their name, email, password, and event preferences (e.g., workshops, seminars).
- **Login**: Users can log in using their email and password, after which they will receive a JWT token.
- **Event Preferences**: Users can set their event preferences, which will be stored in their profile for personalized event recommendations.

**Backend API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Login a user.

**Frontend**: Users can use a registration form that posts data to the backend and then use a login form to authenticate and retrieve a JWT token for further requests.

### 2. **Event Listings & RSVP**

- **Event Listings**: Users can view a list of all upcoming events with details like the name, date, time, location, and available seats.
- **RSVP**: Users can RSVP to an event, and the available seats for that event will be updated. The event is saved to the user's profile.

**Backend API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/events`: Get all upcoming events.
- `POST /api/events/rsvp/:eventId`: RSVP to an event and update available seats.

**Frontend**: Events are displayed in a list format. Users can click on an event to RSVP, and the available seats will be updated in real-time.

### 3. **Event Creation (Admin Only)**

- **Admin Role**: Only admins can create new events. The event will include a name, description, date, location, and capacity.
- **Unique Event ID**: Each event will have a unique ID, which is automatically generated by the database.
  
**Backend API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/admin/events`: Admin can create a new event.

**Frontend**: Admins can access a form that allows them to create new events. The form will send data to the backend to store the new event in the database.

### 4. **Event Calendar View**

- **Calendar View**: Users can view a calendar showing upcoming events by date.
- **Filters**: Users can filter the events based on their event preferences (e.g., only show workshops).
  
**Backend API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/events`: Retrieve events for calendar display.

**Frontend**: The calendar view is created using a calendar library such as **FullCalendar.js** or custom React components. Events are fetched from the backend and displayed in the calendar format.
